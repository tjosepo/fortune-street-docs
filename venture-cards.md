# Venture Cards

Venture cards can be selected when a player lands on a suit square or a venture square.

The cards will be layed out at random on a 8 by 8 board. Despite the board only having 64 tiles, there are >124 cards in total. Some cards might not appear on the board at all in a given game.

Players are encouraged to select cards from the same column or row as they will gain an increasing amount of `G` the longer their row/column is.

## Notes

### Closed shops


### Player in first & last place
  In case of a tie, the most favorable outcome for the current player is always selected. 

  For example, with Card No. 4, if there is a tie, all players in first place will pay the current player. 

  With Card No. 44, if there is a tie and the current player is in last place so he will not pay anyone else.
